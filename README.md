# Ana's Composition Portfolio
My composition portfolio with all the little bits of music I make now and then.
## Copyright
Some of the music I put here is original, and others are covers. I decided it was time to make a portfolio of all of it so I could access it all easily from one place in the future. 
Please don't claim any of my work as your own without my permission - all rights for my originals belong to me, and those of my covers belong to the respective artists who created them.
